Add `useCrashReporter()` — cross-platform crash capture, persistence, and rehydration. Captures uncaught errors (web `window.onerror`/`unhandledrejection`, iOS `NSSetUncaughtExceptionHandler`, Android `Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler` chaining to the previous handler), persists the report (localStorage / Application Support / app files dir), and rehydrates the previous session's report on the next launch — the credential-free half of crash reporting. The vendor transport (Sentry, a custom endpoint) is app-wired via `setCrashTransport` / `PyreonCrashTransportRegistry`, so the framework never fakes an upload. `useCrashReporter()` lowers to both native targets (SwiftUI + Compose); the Android factory self-installs a file-backed backend so the report survives the crash it reports. Signal crashes (iOS) and NDK crashes (Android) are disclosed out of v1 scope.
