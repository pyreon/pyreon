The entrance animation crosses. On the web, `animate` was wired on `<PlotChart>` only: the fourteen canvas-host families (treemap, sunburst, tree, river, sankey, graph, gantt, polar, calendar, parallel, funnel, map, boxplot, heatmap) took the prop and never passed the tween's progress to their engine, so they painted fully formed. Each now declares `animates` and hands `progress` to its render (`renderHeatChart` takes it as an optional trailing argument). Natively, both emitters render every host whose engine takes a `progress` — the same set — inside a new `PyreonChartEntrance` runtime view (SwiftUI `TimelineView`, paused once the tween ends; a Compose `Animatable`), which hands the cubic ease-out progress into `ChartSpec.progress`, into a copy of the host's `XOptions`, or as the heatmap wrapper's argument, over `theme.enterMs`; Reduce Motion on iOS and a zero animator scale on Android render at once, like `prefers-reduced-motion`. `animate={false}` emits the host exactly as before. An engine with no entrance (Pie, Radar, Candlestick, Gauge) now names `animate` as inert on every target instead of "not lowered on native".

Two fixes the copy exposed: an inline options literal (`tree={{ symbolSize: 8 }}`) lowered to a synthesized `__Obj0` that swiftc rejected against `TreeOptions` — it is steered to the engine struct now — and a non-nil options value was read with optional chaining in the tooltip and hit paths, an error on a non-optional in Swift.
