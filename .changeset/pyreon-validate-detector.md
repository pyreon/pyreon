Pyreon-specific anti-pattern detector for the MCP `validate` tool (T2.5.2). `@pyreon/compiler` exports a new `detectPyreonPatterns(code, filename)` AST walker catching 9 "using Pyreon wrong" mistakes — `for-missing-by` / `for-with-key` on `<For>`, `props-destructured` at component signatures, `process-dev-gate` (dead code in Vite browser bundles), `empty-theme` no-op chains, `raw-add-event-listener` / `raw-remove-event-listener`, `date-math-random-id` ID schemes, and `on-click-undefined`. `@pyreon/mcp`'s `validate` tool now merges these diagnostics with the existing React detector output, sorted by source line. Every detected pattern is grounded in `.claude/rules/anti-patterns.md` — each bullet there carries a `[detector: <code>]` tag so contributors see what runs statically vs what remains doc-only.
