Fulltext ⌘K search in both workbenches, with match-reason chips.

atlas: the search index now covers keywords, not just names — control keys, enum OPTIONS (the state/variant axes: searching `soft` surfaces every component with a `variant: soft`), scenario names, group paths, and descriptions. Multi-token queries AND across fields; keyword hits carry the matched field as a chip (`variant · soft`, `scenario · Long content`) so a row explains why it surfaced.

loom: the ⌘K dialog arrives (same docs-site shape as atlas — the header keeps the trigger; the query still drives the sidebar filter), fulltext over the fabric: package ids, versions, kind, license, FINDINGS (searching `unused-dep` lists every flagged package with a `finding · unused-dep` chip), and the dependency edges in both directions (`depends on · X` / `needed by · X`).
