Migrate `@pyreon/runtime-server` onto the manifest-driven docs pipeline.

`@pyreon/runtime-server` is the SSR/SSG renderer (`renderToString` / `renderToStream` / `runWithRequestContext` / `configureStoreIsolation` / `decodeKeyFromMarker`) — a real server API surface AI agents query — but it had NO `src/manifest.ts`, no api-reference markers, and was entirely absent from `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt` / MCP `api-reference.ts`. `get_api(runtime-server, …)` 404'd for the whole surface. PR B of the recommended manifest-coverage follow-up sequence (PR A = the doc-claim correction, #623; #622 = compiler).

**Added** `packages/core/runtime-server/src/manifest.ts` via `defineManifest()` — all 5 public exports as `api[]` entries with accurate signatures + dense `summary` + the real SSR foot-guns in `mistakes[]`: SSR is one-shot (no server reactivity; signals snapshot at render time), Suspense streams out-of-order with a 30s-timeout-keeps-fallback contract, `runWithRequestContext` must wrap the whole `prefetch + render` sequence or loader data is lost, `configureStoreIsolation` MUST be called once at startup or concurrent requests share one global store registry (cross-user SSR state bleed), `<head>` flushes before Suspense resolves. 3 package gotchas (no server reactivity / usually consumed via `@pyreon/server` / the server `typeof process` dev-gate convention).

**Wiring:** `@pyreon/manifest` added as a `workspace:*` devDependency (the `@pyreon/lint` / `@pyreon/compiler` convention — `manifest.ts` is gen-docs-only, tree-shaken from published `lib/`). Surgical 3-line bun.lock add; `bun install --frozen-lockfile` verified (unrelated fresh-worktree version-field churn reverted to base). api-reference marker pair added between the `@pyreon/runtime-dom` and `@pyreon/store` regions; `bun run gen-docs` regenerated the `llms.txt` bullet, the `llms-full.txt` `## @pyreon/runtime-server` section, and the 5-entry MCP region; hand-prose `## Core Framework` count 6 → 7.

**No runtime or API change** — purely additive doc metadata. `gen-docs --check` in sync; lint 0 errors; typecheck clean (runtime-server + mcp); runtime-server 143 tests, mcp 497, manifest 135 all green; `check-manifest-depth` passes (runtime-server enters at port-grade density and is intentionally NOT added to `LOCKED` — visible migration backlog, not yet flagship). New `manifest-snapshot.test.ts` (5 specs) locks the rendered bullet/section/api-reference shape + the foot-gun-catalog assertions locally in addition to the CI `Docs Sync` gate.
