Live Program Inlay Hints (LPIH) — runtime + compiler + LSP foundation. A new category of editor surface: **live runtime data displayed at the source line, the same way TypeScript shows inferred types**. No reactive framework today shows fire counts / subscriber counts / effect re-run rates at the cursor — developers context-switch to a separate devtools panel. LPIH closes that gap.

```tsx
function App() {
  const count = signal(0)             // 🔥 signal fired 240×
  const doubled = computed(() => count() * 2)  // 🔥 derived fired 240×
  effect(() => console.log(doubled()))         // 🔥 effect fired 241×
  return <div>{count()}</div>
}
```

**`@pyreon/reactivity`**: source-location capture at every `signal()` / `computed()` / `effect()` creation, wired through `_rdRegister` and exposed via `getFireSummaries()`. The runtime bridge ships at the new subpath export `@pyreon/reactivity/lpih`: `writeLpihCache(path)` + `startLpihPolling(path, intervalMs)` writes the current fire snapshot to a JSON cache file atomically (tmp + rename — readers never see a half-written file; failed renames clean up the tmp). Subpath keeps the main entry slim — bridge depends on `node:fs/promises` (Node-only) and is dev-mode glue, not a core primitive. New main-entry exports: `SourceLocation`, `FireSummary`, `getFireSummaries`. New `/lpih` subpath exports: `writeLpihCache`, `startLpihPolling`. **Zero production cost** (existing `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` gate tree-shakes the entire capture path — verified by the existing `reactive-devtools-treeshake.test.ts`). Dev-mode opt-in cost: `_active === true` triggers `new Error().stack` capture (~2.2µs per creation). At realistic real-app creation rates (100-1000 signals total / 100/sec peak), per-session cost is **0.2-2.3ms** — invisible. Stack-parser handles V8, JSC, and SpiderMonkey formats. 21 new tests (15 source-location + 6 bridge).

**`@pyreon/compiler`**: two new pure functions that bridge runtime fire data to LSP inlay hints. `mergeFireDataIntoFindings(findings, fires, file)` enriches static Reactivity-Lens findings with fire counts at matching source lines. `firesToCreationSiteFindings(fires, file)` synthesizes inlay-hint findings DIRECTLY from fires — creation-line hints showing `signal fired 240×` at the line where `signal()` was called. New exports: `mergeFireDataIntoFindings`, `firesToCreationSiteFindings`, `LPIHFireDatum`, `LPIHMergeOptions`. 24 new tests covering merge semantics, kind filtering (footguns/static spans NOT enriched), file normalization, aggregation, custom formatters, plus end-to-end `analyzeReactivity + merge` integration.

**`@pyreon/lint`**: LSP `textDocument/inlayHint` handler reads `PYREON_LPIH_CACHE` env var on each request, parses the cache file (silent failure on missing/malformed JSON), and emits creation-site inlay hints with the `🔥 signal fired N×` label. Opt-in via env var — when unset, LPIH path is a no-op and existing static Reactivity-Lens hints work unchanged. New internal exports: `_readLpihCache`, `LPIHCacheEntry`, `LPIHCacheFile`. 15 new JSON-RPC roundtrip tests covering cache file parsing (malformed JSON, missing entries, shape validation), LSP handler integration (env-var-driven cache read, visible-range filtering with LPIH active, graceful degradation), end-to-end `initialize → didOpen → inlayHint` with real cache file.

**Measured impact (reproducible via `bun .claude/experiments/lpih-measurement.ts`)**:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| LSP roundtrip latency (median, 20-trial) | **0.32 ms** |
| LSP roundtrip latency (p95) | **2.78 ms** |
| User-perceived save→hint (incl. 150ms debounce) | **~150 ms** |
| Bridge write (atomic JSON file) | **1.5 ms** |
| End-to-end bridge-to-editor | **~1.8 ms + 250ms poll interval** |
| Production overhead | **0 ns** (tree-shaken) |
| Dev-mode active overhead | 2.2 µs per signal creation |
| Workflow "which signal fires most?" | 9 → 2 steps (**4.5× reduction**) |
| Workflow "is this effect over-running?" | 8 → 2 steps (**4× reduction**) |
| Workflow "did memoization help?" | 10 → 4 steps (**2.5× reduction**) |
| Information surface per medium component | ~9 hints inline vs 0 in editor (devtools-only) |

**Architecture**: Three-layer (runtime captures source location → bridge writes JSON cache file → LSP reads + merges into inlay hints). Bisect-verified: reverting the LSP wiring fails 11/15 integration tests; restored, 15/15 pass. The cache-file bridge mechanism is filesystem-only (no IPC, no WebSocket) — chosen because LSP servers are stdio-only and filesystem is the universal lowest-common-denominator transport. The LSP re-reads on every inlay-hint request so live edits land immediately. Future build-time location injection via `@pyreon/vite-plugin` will replace stack capture with compile-time literals, eliminating the dev-mode 2.2µs/creation overhead entirely. The editor extension (VS Code / Neovim) that auto-bridges devtools fire data to the cache file is a follow-up.

**Docs**: new VitePress page at [docs/docs/lpih.md](docs/docs/lpih.md) with quickstart, API reference, measured numbers, and 3 concrete bug-hunting scenarios (with vs without LPIH workflow comparison).
