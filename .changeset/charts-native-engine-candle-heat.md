The candlestick and heatmap geometry join the generated native chart engine (`PyreonChartEngine.swift` / `.kt`): `ohlcExtent`, `renderCandles`, `buildHeatGrid`, `colorRamp`, `HEAT_RAMP` and `renderHeat` now lower with zero transform warnings and compile on both toolchains. Two engine-side idioms made it possible with no behavior change on web: `renderCandles` takes an OPTIONAL options object (an empty-object-literal default has no native lowering) and `buildHeatGrid` keys its aggregation map by an INDEX into the cells array (a Map with a struct value has no native lowering).
