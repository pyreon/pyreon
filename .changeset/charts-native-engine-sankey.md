Sankey geometry joins the generated native chart engine. `layoutSankey` / `renderSankey` / `ribbonPoints` are rewritten in the PMTC subset (name lookups are scans, the relaxation stack/resolve steps are inlined, comparator sorts are insertion sorts, no `Infinity`) and bundled into `PyreonChartEngine.swift` / `.kt`. The engine answers hits as INDICES (`hitSankeyIndex` → `{ node, link }`); the web-facing `hitSankey` union lives in `sankey-hit.ts` and `sankeyToSvg` moves to `family-svg.ts` (`@pyreon/charts/plot` re-exports are unchanged). `renderSankey` no longer takes a measurer (labels do not need one).
