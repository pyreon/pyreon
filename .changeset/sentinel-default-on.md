Singleton sentinel default-on across every `@pyreon/*` package with module-level state (PR A of the bullet-proof cross-module-instance plan, `.claude/plans/jaunty-herding-kazoo.md`).

Each package's `src/index.ts` now calls `registerSingleton('@pyreon/<name>', <version>, import.meta.url)` at module load. The first registration records a marker on `globalThis`; a second registration with a DIFFERENT normalized location triggers detection. Default mode throws an actionable Error naming both file paths and three concrete fixes (Vite `resolve.dedupe`, `npm ls`, `bun ls`). `PYREON_SINGLE_INSTANCE=warn` demotes to `console.error`; `PYREON_SINGLE_INSTANCE=silent` opts out entirely (browser extensions, micro-frontends, nested SSR via `rocketstyle-collapse`).

**HMR-aware.** Vite re-evaluates modules with the SAME path but possibly different query params (`?v=12345`, `?t=12345`, `?import`). The sentinel normalizes the location (strips query string) before comparing — same normalized location → HMR re-eval → silently allowed; different location → genuine dual-instance → throws.

**Per-package detection.** The earlier prototype put the sentinel only in `@pyreon/reactivity` — insufficient because `@pyreon/core` (and every other package) has its own module-level state that can be silently corrupted under dual-load. The full plan requires per-package registration, which this PR ships.

**Zero behavior change in correct setups.** Apps that already have a single instance of each `@pyreon/*` package (the overwhelmingly common case) see no runtime change. Apps with silently-tolerated duplicates today (sub-dep version mismatch, custom bundler config) will see their app throw at startup after upgrading with an error message naming the fix. `PYREON_SINGLE_INSTANCE=warn` is the immediate mitigation for any consumer surprised by the change.

**Test coverage.** Contract tests at `packages/core/reactivity/src/tests/singleton-sentinel.test.ts` (57 specs) exercise the sentinel directly with synthetic `file://` URLs: default-mode throw + actionable error message, HMR re-eval allowance, `PYREON_SINGLE_INSTANCE=warn` / `=silent` escape hatches, per-package coverage across all 24 registered packages, and cross-package isolation. Bisect-verified — neutralizing the throw branch fails 49 positive-case tests; restored passes all 57. The synthetic-URL approach replaces the heavier filesystem dual-load reproducer (it's the sentinel's normalized-string comparison that matters, not Node's ESM loader behaviour).
