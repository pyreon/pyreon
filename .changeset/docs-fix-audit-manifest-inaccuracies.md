docs: fix 4 audit-found manifest inaccuracies that shipped wrong claims to AI assistants via MCP

- **runtime-dom (safety-inverted):** `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is intentionally RAW (React parity — developer owns sanitization); the manifest claimed it was sanitized. Also corrected: the Sanitizer API (`el.setHTML`) lives only in the `innerHTML` PROP sink (where it bypasses a custom `setSanitizer` policy), `sanitizeHtml()` itself is always the custom-or-DOMParser allowlist; `_bindText` is emitted for non-computed member chains too (with a `caller` 3rd arg preserving `this`), not "only a bare signal identifier"; KeepAlive's non-thunk `active={cond}` THROWS `TypeError` at mount (no `<Show when>`-style value normalization), it is not "captured once".
- **validate:** `parseReactiveAsync` DOES supersede stale results (internal version counter — an awaited stale frame resolves to the latest run's verdict); the mistakes entry claimed the opposite. The true residual caveat is no AbortSignal (in-flight validators run to completion). Also updated the stale union prod-crash string (`member._runInto is not a function`, not `member["~standard"] is undefined`).
- **router:** `onBeforeRouteLeave` called outside setup DOES register (unconditional `router.beforeEach`) — the real failure mode is a LEAKED guard (the `onUnmount` auto-removal never attaches), not "never registers". RouterView also accepts an optional `router` prop.
- **hooks:** `useScrollLock`'s per-instance `isLocked` guard makes an extra `unlock()` a no-op — it can NOT release another component's lock; corrected to teach the real limitation (one instance holds at most one refcount unit and does not nest).
- **validation:** schema libraries are detected by duck-typing `~standard` with zero dependency records — they are no longer declared as optional peer dependencies.
- **compiler:** `_bind` is imported from `@pyreon/reactivity` (not runtime-dom/core).
