'@pyreon/charts': patch
---

Docs: the README gains a "Native geometry" section stating that every `@pyreon/charts/plot` family is generated into `PyreonChartEngine.swift` / `.kt`, which API shapes exist because of the crossing (index hits, `{ min, max }` domains, ISO/day dates, `rampColor`, `calendarValues`, `parallelRows`, the seeded LCG), and what stays web-only (hosts, gestures, sonification, the tween, the option facade); the manifest's multiplatform rationale says the same.
