Add a known-slot fast path to `mountFor`'s LIS reconciler that fires when `tails[v] === v`. This eliminates all binary-search probes on prepend-heavy patterns (`items.set([...newRows, ...items()])` — infinite-scroll feeds, chat history prepends, log tails) and cuts probes ~40-56% on random shuffles. Pure algorithmic optimization; no behavior change. Measured: 1k prepend 9 978 → 0 LIS probes, 1k random shuffle 5 117 → 2 255-2 982 probes across 5 seeds.
