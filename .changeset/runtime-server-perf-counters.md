Close the two perf-harness instrumentation blind spots. Adds 7 dev-mode SSR counters (`runtime-server.render`, `.stream`, `.component`, `.escape`, `.suspense.boundary`, `.suspense.fallback`, `.for.keyMarker`) to `@pyreon/runtime-server` and the `runtime.tpl` counter (cloneNode fast-path invocation count) to `@pyreon/runtime-dom`. All gated on the appropriate dev check so zero production cost — measured overhead on a 1k-row SSR render is ~5% in dev with a sink installed, within noise without. The SSR emit contract is verified by 10 probe tests covering shape (exact counts), scaling (1k and 10k rows, no quadratic emits), escape density, and server-side runtime gating. The `runtime.tpl` counter is verified by 2 probe tests plus the existing Vite tree-shake regression guard.
