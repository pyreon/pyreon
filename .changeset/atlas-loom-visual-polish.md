Visual polish for both workbenches.

atlas: the dev shell now loads its webfonts (Space Grotesk / Public Sans / JetBrains Mono — previously nothing loaded a font and the whole UI fell back to the browser serif) and the theme ships real `font.sans`/`font.display` stacks applied on the Shell. Fixed the needsFix-tag layout gap where a button's children stacked vertically ignoring the theme's row/gap (the flex-fix inner span is now `display: contents`), the status bar's column-stacked texts, and the addon tab strip clipping half its tabs (wraps instead of hidden overflow).

loom: the layered graph now scales to a full workspace — ambient edges drop to a whisper (0.1 opacity), the selected fan no longer flares over its neighborhood, node labels get a background halo (`paint-order: stroke`) so 700 edges never strike through text, long package names truncate with a native tooltip, and version sublabels render only on the selected/focused neighborhood.
