`router.preload(path, request?, options?)` gains an optional third `options` argument with `skipLoaders: true` — bypasses the loader-running step while keeping lazy-component resolution intact (so the synthetic chain still renders cleanly). The SSG plugin's `__renderNotFound` now passes `{ isNotFound: true }` through `renderPath` → `router.preload(probePath, undefined, { skipLoaders: true })`, so auth-touching parent-layout loaders (`fetchUser`, session reads, private APIs) no longer fire during static 404 generation. Closes the documented "Loaders on parent layouts run during 404 render" limitation. Runtime SSR intentionally still runs loaders for 404 — analytics / audit-logging hooks that fire per-request should keep firing even when the request resolves to a not-found. Bisect-verified at the unit layer (4 new specs in `router.preload — PR C — skipLoaders`). Back-compat: the new arg is positional and optional, so 2-arg callers (`router.preload(path, request)`) continue to work unchanged.
