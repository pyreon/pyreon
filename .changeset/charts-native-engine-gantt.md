Gantt geometry joins the generated native chart engine, built on the calendar family's Date-free civil arithmetic. BREAKING (pre-1.0, clean API): time is DAYS since 1970-01-01 everywhere — `GanttTask.start` / `end` and `GanttOptions.today` are ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` strings only (epoch-ms values and the `Date.parse` fallback are gone; convert with `formatIsoDate`), `GanttOptions.domain` is a `GanttRange` (`{ start, end }`, ISO) instead of a tuple, `GanttLayout.domain` is a `Domain` (`{ min, max }` in days), `GanttRow.startMs` / `endMs` become `startDay` / `endDay`, `GanttRow.label` is the name string with `labelAt` beside it, and `GanttLayout.today` becomes `hasToday` + `todayX`. `ganttTicks` takes and returns days (`GanttTick[]`, `x` filled by the layout). The engine answers hits as an index (`hitGanttIndex`); the nullable `hitGantt` lives in `engine/gantt-web.ts` and `ganttToSvg` in `family-svg.ts` — the `@pyreon/charts/plot` re-exports and `<GanttChart>` are unchanged.
