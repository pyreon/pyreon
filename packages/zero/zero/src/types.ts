   * are NOT included by default (auth-bearing requests need an
   * explicit `cacheKey`).
   *
   * **Default changed from `url.pathname` to `url.pathname + url.search`
   * in v0.27.** Previously, `/posts?id=42` and `/posts?id=99` shared
   * the same cache entry — the first request's HTML served the second
   * user's content. The new default is safe for query-varied content;
   * see the two trade-offs below for tuning.
   *
   * **⚠️ Auth-gated incompatibility — still applies.** The default
   * does NOT include cookies / Authorization headers. A loader that
   * reads `request.headers.get('cookie')` to gate auth will render
   * ONCE with the first user's cookie, then serve that HTML to every
   * subsequent user (matched only by URL). To use ISR with personalized
   * / auth-gated pages, supply a `cacheKey` that varies on the auth
   * identifier (session cookie, user-id header, etc.), OR don't use
   * ISR for such routes — use SSR instead.
   *
   * **⚠️ High-cardinality query params.** Analytics tokens (`utm_*`,
   * `fbclid`, `gclid`, `mc_eid`) cause cache explosion under the new
   * default — one entry per click variant. For routes that ignore
   * query strings entirely, opt back to pathname-only:
   * `cacheKey: (req) => new URL(req.url).pathname`. A dev-mode warning
   * fires at handler init when no explicit `cacheKey` is configured
   * (once per handler instance, never in production).

   * // Vary cache by session cookie (auth-gated pages):

   *   revalidate: 60,
   *   cacheKey: (req) => {
   *     const url = new URL(req.url)

     * **Why this matters — the slash-less-URL 301.** With `'directory'`

     *
     * **Choosing a value:**
     * - `'both'` is the safe recommendation when redirects matter. It keeps
     *   trailing-slash links working (`<Link to="/resume/">`, the
     *   trailing-slash URLs `seoPlugin`'s sitemap advertises → served by the
     *   directory form) AND serves slash-less share URLs with no redirect
     *   (the file form). Cost: one extra HTML file per route.
     * - `'file'` is leanest but a page is then reachable ONLY at its
     *   slash-less URL — a host that maps `/resume/` → `/resume/index.html`
     *   will 404 the trailing-slash form, so avoid it if your app emits

     * Route-level code splitting in SSG mode. Default `true`.

     * lands on plus its dependencies ship in the initial bundle, the
     * rest fetch on navigation. Matches the SSR/SPA-mode behaviour zero

     *
     * When `false`, every route is bundled statically into the main
     * client chunk (the pre-2026-Q3 SSG behaviour). Useful for tiny

     * first paint).

     * Underlying mechanism is the same 3-tier generator zero already

     * component + inlined metadata when possible, lazy + lazy-thunked
     * function exports when not, namespace-import fallback for cases
