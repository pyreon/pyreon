# @pyreon/native-runtime-swift

## 0.51.0

### Minor Changes

- `useFieldArray` lowers to native on both targets — dynamic form lists with (9590027)
  stable keys, device-proven.

  - **Runtimes**: `PyreonFieldArray` (Swift `@Observable` / Kotlin
    `SnapshotStateList`) mirrors the web `@pyreon/form` surface one-for-one:
    `items` (keyed rows), `length`, `append`, `prepend`, `insert`, `remove`,
    `update`, `move`, `swap`, `replace`, `values`. Keys are monotone and never
    reused — a removal never re-keys survivors (row identity/focus survives),
    `replace` always re-keys. Byte-aligned contract suites on both platforms.
  - **Compiler**: `useFieldArray(['a'])` lowers on both targets (String-
    specialized v1 — the PMTC form vocabulary is String-typed; initial must be
    an array literal, the useWebSocket literal rule). The load-bearing seam is
    the ACCESSOR UNWRAP: on web `tags.items()` / `tags.length()` /
    `item.value()` are signal calls, natively they are properties — the emit
    strips the parens (For-item params tracked through
    `<For each={tags.items()} by={i => i.key}>`, which lowers to
    `ForEach(tags.items, id: \.key)` / `items(tags.items, key = { it.key })`),
    and the validate stubs mirror the property shape so a paren-keeping emit
    fails both toolchain gates by construction. `move` emits with Swift labels
    (`move(from:to:)`).

  Device-proven in router-demo on both platforms (add renders the row,
  remove-first drops exactly row 0 with the survivor still rendered, count
  tracks length) and bisect-verified by no-oping the runtime `remove()` on
  both.

- `useSecureStorage` is real on all three targets — the encrypted secret store (9590027)
  (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore AES-GCM / web in-memory), device-proven.

  The sub-capability was three-quarters missing: the PMTC emit was a warn-drop
  ("deferred v1"), the Kotlin runtime shipped no real backend (in-memory only,
  behind an app-injection requirement the compiler could not satisfy), and the
  web half did not exist, so the shared import resolved on neither web app.

  - **`@pyreon/native-runtime-kotlin`**: `KeystoreSecureBackend(context)` —
    AndroidKeyStore AES-256-GCM over app-private SharedPreferences (no new
    gradle dependency; androidx security-crypto is deprecated and wrapped
    exactly this surface) + a `PyreonSecureStorage(context)` factory, the
    `PyreonDatabase(context)` shape. Fail-closed reads (tampered/undecryptable
    → null).
  - **`@pyreon/native-runtime-swift` + `-kotlin` (BREAKING, pre-1.0)**:
    `write` is now KEY-FIRST — `write(key:value:)` / `write(key, value)`. The
    old `write(value, key)` order was a live hazard: both parameters are
    String, so a positional lowering of the natural TS call
    `sec.write('auth', token)` would have compiled with the arguments crossed
    and stored the secret under the wrong key.
  - **`@pyreon/native-compiler`**: `useSecureStorage()` lowers on both targets
    (Swift `PyreonSecureStorage()` Keychain default; Kotlin Context-threaded
    Keystore default); method calls emit with Swift labels
    (`write(key:value:)`), making a crossed positional call uncompilable.
    Validate stubs mirror the real key-first surface on both toolchains.
  - **`@pyreon/hooks`**: the web `useSecureStorage()` — a module-scoped
    in-memory store (the web has no OS secret store; persisting secrets to
    localStorage would be the exact bug the hook prevents), same key-first
    surface.

  Device-proven in router-demo and bisect-verified on both platforms by
  swapping the defaults to the in-memory backend: iOS's secret survives a
  genuine terminate+relaunch only with the real Keychain; Android's cold
  `PyreonSecureStorage(context)` decrypts the UI's write and the raw prefs
  value is asserted to be ciphertext, not plaintext (encryption at rest).

### Patch Changes

- `useAppState()` now observes the real app lifecycle with zero wiring — the third member of the never-wired class. Swift: the emit calls `PyreonAppState.start()` from `.onAppear` on the stable host (the UIApplication notification observers existed from inception; nothing called them). Kotlin: `rememberPyreonAppState()` installs a `LifecycleEventObserver` on the hosting Activity for the composable's lifetime (ON_RESUME/ON_PAUSE/ON_STOP → active/inactive/background). Both containers gain a sticky `wasBackgrounded` flag — the device-assertable end-state a frozen container can never reach. (a8c9fab)
- `useFetch(url, { method, headers, body })` now reaches the wire on iOS and (25b5f5a)
  Android. Every field of that init object was previously read by nobody — the
  native parser only looked at the first argument — so both targets emitted a
  plain GET and an app asking for a POST silently performed the wrong verb with
  no diagnostic anywhere.

  Requests carrying a verb, headers or a body now lower to `PyreonHttp`, which
  had shipped on both runtimes with full verb support and nothing calling it:
  Swift had a live `URLSession` edge no emit reached, and Android had an executor
  interface whose real OkHttp implementation did not exist (`PyreonHttpOkHttp`,
  new here). A non-2xx now rejects rather than being handed to the JSON decoder,
  where it read as "the server sent bad JSON" instead of a 404. Values the
  compiler cannot bake — a computed method, a `JSON.stringify(...)` body — now
  WARN loudly instead of degrading to a GET.

  Two pre-existing breaks in the same container, both fixed here and both hidden
  by the fact that every existing example fetches an array and reads
  `data() ?? []`:

  - a single-object `data()?.field` read emitted `data.field` on Swift, which
    does not compile — the inference reported the container's `data` as
    non-optional even though the web hook, Swift and Kotlin all declare it
    optional, so the member emit stripped the `?.` the author wrote;
  - `error()` in call form inferred `unknown`, so `{f.error() ? … }` emitted a
    bare `Throwable?` as a Kotlin condition ("condition type mismatch").

  `@pyreon/hooks`: `useFetch` takes an optional second argument (`UseFetchInit` —
  `method` / `headers` / `body`), matching the native lowering.

  **`useFetch` decoding on Android now matches iOS.** kotlinx.serialization's
  default `Json` THROWS on a JSON key the target type does not declare; Swift's
  `JSONDecoder` silently ignores it. The emit used the bare default, so the same
  shared `useFetch<T>(url)` against the same server decoded fine on iOS and threw
  on Android the moment the response carried one extra field — i.e. against
  essentially every real API, since a server returning exactly the fields one
  client declares is the exception. Decoding now goes through
  `PyreonFetchJson` (`Json { ignoreUnknownKeys = true }`).

  This was PRE-EXISTING and is not limited to the new verb path — the plain GET
  path decoded the same way. It stayed invisible because the only device-proven
  fetch fixture is a hand-written `quotes.json` whose shape matches its type
  exactly; measured on a real emulator, a 200 response with one extra field
  raised `JsonDecodingException: Encountered an unknown key 'contentType'` while
  the identical iOS run passed.

  Deliberately scoped: `ignoreUnknownKeys` only. NOT `isLenient` (malformed JSON
  is a real error worth surfacing) and NOT `explicitNulls = false`.

- Make the native stack publishable — it was `private: true` while `pyreon new --native` shipped and advertised it. (6378982)

  A scaffolded multiplatform app declares five `@pyreon/native-*` packages and
  resolves the Swift/Kotlin runtimes **out of `node_modules`** — XcodeGen consumes
  `../node_modules/@pyreon/native-runtime-swift` as a local SPM package, Gradle
  adds `../../node_modules/@pyreon/native-runtime-kotlin/src/main/kotlin` as a
  source set. So npm is not an incidental channel, it is the required one. With
  every package private, `npm install` could never fetch them: the paths did not
  exist and the native build could not run. That is why multiplatform was
  unusable outside a workspace checkout, regardless of compiler capability.

  Two of the six needed real work, not just a manifest flag:

  **`@pyreon/native-cli` shipped a `.ts` bin.** `bin` pointed at `./src/cli.ts`,
  and the scaffolded builds invoke it as `npx pyreon-native build …` — i.e. under
  **node**. Measured: node cannot execute it even on v26's type-stripping path,
  because the source uses extensionless relative imports (`./build`) that bun
  accepts and node's ESM resolver rejects. Now builds to `lib/` and ships a
  hand-written `bin/pyreon-native.js` that calls `main()` **explicitly** rather
  than relying on `cli.ts`'s `import.meta.main` guard — that guard is Bun-only
  (undefined on Node < 24.2) _and_ is dropped by the bundler, the exact
  combination that shipped `pyreon-lint` as a silent no-op in every published
  version.

  **`@pyreon/native-compiler` had no build at all** — its exports pointed straight
  at `src/index.ts`, so publishing would have shipped raw TypeScript to a
  consumer resolving `import`. Now builds to `lib/` with proper types.

  The four runtime/router packages ship SOURCE by design (Swift files for SPM,
  Kotlin for Gradle) and needed only `publishConfig.access` + `sideEffects`;
  tarball contents verified (Package.swift + Sources; 65 `.kt` files).

  Also fixes `--help`, which exited **1** and printed to **stderr**. For a
  published CLI that breaks any script or CI step checking exit codes, and hides
  usage from a plain `| grep`. Now exit 0 on stdout; error paths unchanged.

  Verified end to end: the built bin runs under **both node and bun**, produces
  byte-identical Swift and Kotlin for both targets, and `check-bin-liveness` now
  covers it — the gate caught the new bin as uncovered and failed closed, which is
  what it exists to do. `publish.ts --dry-run` completes with all six included.

  Nothing is published by this change; it only makes publishing possible.

- `usePush()` now receives notifications with zero app wiring — the receipt half was the never-wired class. Swift: the no-arg `PyreonPushNotifications.start()` (called by the emit from `.onAppear` on the stable host) installs a container-owned `UNUserNotificationCenter` delegate — foreground presentation and taps land in `notificationReceived`, `requestAuthorization` drives `authorize`; `simctl push` exercises exactly this pipeline, credential-free. Kotlin: `rememberPyreonPushNotifications()` registers a NOT_EXPORTED BroadcastReceiver delivery seam on `PYREON_PUSH_ACTION` for the composable's lifetime (an FCM service forwards into the same seam). The APNs token and FCM transport stay app-wired via `start(register)` — the first start of either kind wins. (5abe7c4)
- `PyreonWebSocket.isConnected` now flips on the real handshake, not on `resume()`. (470af1d)

  `connect(to:)` called `opened()` immediately after `task.resume()`, which only means the connection was _requested_. A socket pointed at a dead or unreachable server therefore read as connected, and any UI gating on `isConnected` showed a live connection that never existed. Kotlin has always flipped on OkHttp's real `onOpen`; this brings Swift to the same contract rather than documenting the difference.

  The flag is now driven by a `URLSessionWebSocketDelegate` (`didOpenWithProtocol` / `didCloseWith`). The delegate is a separate object because `URLSession` retains its delegate — making the `@Observable` container itself the delegate would create a cycle it could not break — and it is released alongside the session in `close()`.

  A pre-existing lifecycle test asserted the old behaviour with the comment _"opened() fired optimistically on resume"_, so it could never have caught this. Its real invariant (the connect/close lifecycle and its idempotency) is unchanged; only that one assertion moves to the corrected truth.

- `<Video src autoPlay? loop? muted? controls? onStatusChange?>` — the canonical video-playback primitive. Web `<video>` (playsinline, media events → `onStatusChange`); iOS `PyreonVideoPlayer` (AVKit `VideoPlayer` over `AVPlayer`, KVO `timeControlStatus` → the same `waiting`/`playing`/`paused` vocabulary); Android `PyreonVideoPlayer` (Media3 ExoPlayer in an `AndroidView`, `Player.Listener`). The create-multiplatform Android template gains the media3 artifacts — and the okhttp artifact the runtime srcDir has required since the networking arc (absent from the template, masked because scaffolds install the runtime from npm, which lagged the workspace; the next release would have shipped scaffolded Android apps uncompilable).
