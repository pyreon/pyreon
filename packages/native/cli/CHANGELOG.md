### Patch Changes

- Make the native stack publishable — it was `private: true` while `pyreon new --native` shipped and advertised it. (6378982)

  A scaffolded multiplatform app declares five `@pyreon/native-*` packages and
  resolves the Swift/Kotlin runtimes **out of `node_modules`** — XcodeGen consumes
  `../node_modules/@pyreon/native-runtime-swift` as a local SPM package, Gradle
  adds `../../node_modules/@pyreon/native-runtime-kotlin/src/main/kotlin` as a
  source set. So npm is not an incidental channel, it is the required one. With
  every package private, `npm install` could never fetch them: the paths did not
  exist and the native build could not run. That is why multiplatform was
  unusable outside a workspace checkout, regardless of compiler capability.

  Two of the six needed real work, not just a manifest flag:

  **`@pyreon/native-cli` shipped a `.ts` bin.** `bin` pointed at `./src/cli.ts`,
  and the scaffolded builds invoke it as `npx pyreon-native build …` — i.e. under
  **node**. Measured: node cannot execute it even on v26's type-stripping path,
  because the source uses extensionless relative imports (`./build`) that bun
  accepts and node's ESM resolver rejects. Now builds to `lib/` and ships a
  hand-written `bin/pyreon-native.js` that calls `main()` **explicitly** rather
  than relying on `cli.ts`'s `import.meta.main` guard — that guard is Bun-only
  (undefined on Node < 24.2) _and_ is dropped by the bundler, the exact
  combination that shipped `pyreon-lint` as a silent no-op in every published
  version.

  **`@pyreon/native-compiler` had no build at all** — its exports pointed straight
  at `src/index.ts`, so publishing would have shipped raw TypeScript to a
  consumer resolving `import`. Now builds to `lib/` with proper types.

  The four runtime/router packages ship SOURCE by design (Swift files for SPM,
  Kotlin for Gradle) and needed only `publishConfig.access` + `sideEffects`;
  tarball contents verified (Package.swift + Sources; 65 `.kt` files).

  Also fixes `--help`, which exited **1** and printed to **stderr**. For a
  published CLI that breaks any script or CI step checking exit codes, and hides
  usage from a plain `| grep`. Now exit 0 on stdout; error paths unchanged.

  Verified end to end: the built bin runs under **both node and bun**, produces
  byte-identical Swift and Kotlin for both targets, and `check-bin-liveness` now
  covers it — the gate caught the new bin as uncovered and failed closed, which is
  what it exists to do. `publish.ts --dry-run` completes with all six included.

  Nothing is published by this change; it only makes publishing possible.

- `<Transition>` gains configurable `duration` (ms, static literal) + `easing` (9154c8a)
  (`linear | ease-in | ease-out | ease-in-out`) on both native targets:
  `.animation(.linear(duration: 2.5), value:)` on SwiftUI,
  `AnimatedVisibility(enter/exit = fadeIn/fadeOut(tween(ms, easing)))` on
  Compose, with the CSS easings mapped to the canonical curves. Absent props
  emit byte-identically to the previous default shape (spec-locked); a
  non-literal duration warns + falls back. The CLI's conditional-import table
  learns the animation sub-package symbols (fadeIn/fadeOut/tween/easings) —
  the stub-masked-symbol class, caught by the real gradle build.

### Minor Changes

- [#1268](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/pull/1268) [`33642a8`](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/commit/33642a8ed8ffbbfaed1509fdbf4e4cd6cc1d8253) Thanks [@vitbokisch](https://github.com/vitbokisch)! - Emit import preamble in build output — the `pyreon-native build`
  command now prepends a per-target import block to each emitted file
  (`import SwiftUI` / `import PyreonRuntime` / `import PyreonRouter` on
  Swift; the full Compose + Pyreon-runtime wildcard set on Kotlin).

  Pre-fix every emitted file failed to compile standalone — the user
  had to wrap each output in a hand-written file that supplied the
  missing imports. Generated code now compiles directly against the
  real SwiftUI / Compose toolchain.

  Unused imports are harmless on both targets.
