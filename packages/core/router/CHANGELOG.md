### Patch Changes

- [#901](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/pull/901) [`c862965`](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/commit/c8629652a94ca7d1e8622cd2de5b4ac009874dbf) Thanks [@vitbokisch](https://github.com/vitbokisch)! - Bundle-size shrink across browser-shipped packages — **~7 KB gzipped saved** total. A typical Pyreon app shipping `runtime-dom + reactivity + core + router` is now **~5.7 KB lighter**.

  ## Wins (gzipped, measured at the production-define bundle level)

  | Package               | Before | After | Saved                      |
  | --------------------- | ------ | ----- | -------------------------- |
  | `@pyreon/runtime-dom` | 12,655 | 9,719 | **−2,936 B (−23%)**        |
  | `@pyreon/reactivity`  | 7,870  | 6,328 | **−1,542 B (−20%)**        |
  | `@pyreon/core`        | 4,972  | 4,191 | **−781 B (−16%)**          |
  | `@pyreon/router`      | 10,148 | 9,582 | **−566 B (−6%)**           |
  | `@pyreon/rocketstyle` | 4,390  | 3,992 | **−398 B (−9%)**           |
  | `@pyreon/styler`      | 5,624  | 5,453 | **−171 B (−3%)**           |
  | `@pyreon/server`      | 3,575  | 3,431 | **−144 B (−4%)**           |
  | `@pyreon/attrs`       | 1,017  | 915   | **−102 B (−10%)**          |
  | (8 more)              | ...    | ...   | smaller wins (1–98 B each) |

  17 packages shrunk total. Net **−7,153 B** gzipped across the published Pyreon footprint.

  ## Two complementary fixes

  **1. `check-bundle-budgets.ts` now measures the PRODUCTION-stripped size.** The script's `Bun.build` invocation was missing `define: { 'process.env.NODE_ENV': '"production"' }`. As a result, the budget measurement INCLUDED every `if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') console.warn(...)` string from `lib/` — overstating the real consumer bundle by 5–20% per package and forcing budget bumps for dev-only diagnostic growth that never reaches end users. Real consumers (Vite/Webpack/esbuild) all set this define at their build time; the measurement now matches what they actually ship.

  **2. Removed the `const __DEV__ = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` alias** from 22 files across 7 browser-shipped packages, in favor of the bare gate `if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production')` at the use site. The alias pattern is recognized by `dev-guard-warnings` lint rule but is silently worse for downstream bundle size — Bun.build and several esbuild configurations don't propagate the const-folded value through the alias even when the production define is set. The bare gate folds reliably at the use site because the bundler replaces the expression with a literal `false` directly. This is the bundler-agnostic library convention used by React, Vue, Preact, Solid.

  Pure internal optimization — no API change, no behavior change. DEV mode behavior unchanged (warnings still fire identically in development). The migration is locked in by `pyreon/no-process-dev-gate` lint rule and the regenerated `scripts/bundle-budgets.json` floor.

  ## QA
  - All 1,378 compiler tests + 680 runtime-dom tests + 521 router tests + 168 server tests + 998 zero tests pass (storage test failures are pre-existing on main, unrelated to this PR)
  - Whole-repo `bun run lint` + `typecheck` clean
  - `gen-docs --check` clean
  - `bench:fair` (real-Chromium across 8 frameworks): Pyreon at top of tied cluster on 4 of 7 tests (create-1k, replace-all, partial-update, create-10k), tied in cluster on the other 3 — no regression
  - One pre-existing test (`dev-gate-treeshake.test.ts non-Vite consumer runtime correctness`) updated to reflect the new bare-gate contract: esbuild's `platform: 'browser'` default replacement (`process.env.NODE_ENV = "development"`) folds the bare gate AND the minifier strips the warn body — strictly better than the old `__DEV__` alias pattern the test was guarding

- [#902](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/pull/902) [`b87fbac`](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/commit/b87fbaced0cbeb7304bdc1d358040818e4b1491e) Thanks [@vitbokisch](https://github.com/vitbokisch)! - Ship source maps in published tarballs.

  Every `@pyreon/*` package now ships its `.js.map` and `.d.ts.map` files. The previous `!lib/**/*.map` exclusion in each package's `files` array left every emitted JS file pointing at a `//# sourceMappingURL=*.map` that wasn't actually published — causing Vite (and other bundlers) to log a "Failed to load source map" warning per file on every cold dev start. Real bug in shipped tarballs, not just dev-noise theory.

  The fix is shipping the maps. They make framework stack traces readable: `at mountChild (node_modules/@pyreon/runtime-dom/src/nodes.ts:147)` instead of `at e (node_modules/@pyreon/runtime-dom/lib/index.js:1:42857)`. This matters most when a user hits a framework bug, opens devtools, or sees an unreadable production error from a server-side render. Sentry / Bugsnag / Rollbar can also translate framework frames using the shipped maps; without them, the framework's part of every captured stack stays opaque.

  Cost: ~350KB-1MB per package in `node_modules`. Bundlers (Vite, Webpack, Rollup, esbuild) strip source maps from production builds automatically; they never reach end users. Every comparable library (React, Vue, Solid, Preact, Svelte, TanStack) does this.

  No API changes. The `check-distribution` CI gate inverts to enforce the new contract (maps must be present, not absent).

## 0.25.0

### Patch Changes

- [#883](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/pull/883) [`6075127`](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/commit/60751278894a6ff843c0f6f6c4894c76bcb6a720) Thanks [@vitbokisch](https://github.com/vitbokisch)! - Singleton sentinel default-on across every `@pyreon/*` package with module-level state (PR A of the bullet-proof cross-module-instance plan, `.claude/plans/jaunty-herding-kazoo.md`).

  Each package's `src/index.ts` now calls `registerSingleton('@pyreon/<name>', <version>, import.meta.url)` at module load. The first registration records a marker on `globalThis`; a second registration with a DIFFERENT normalized location triggers detection. Default mode throws an actionable Error naming both file paths and three concrete fixes (Vite `resolve.dedupe`, `npm ls`, `bun ls`). `PYREON_SINGLE_INSTANCE=warn` demotes to `console.error`; `PYREON_SINGLE_INSTANCE=silent` opts out entirely (browser extensions, micro-frontends, nested SSR via `rocketstyle-collapse`).

  **HMR-aware.** Vite re-evaluates modules with the SAME path but possibly different query params (`?v=12345`, `?t=12345`, `?import`). The sentinel normalizes the location (strips query string) before comparing — same normalized location → HMR re-eval → silently allowed; different location → genuine dual-instance → throws.

  **Per-package detection.** The earlier prototype put the sentinel only in `@pyreon/reactivity` — insufficient because `@pyreon/core` (and every other package) has its own module-level state that can be silently corrupted under dual-load. The full plan requires per-package registration, which this PR ships.

  **Zero behavior change in correct setups.** Apps that already have a single instance of each `@pyreon/*` package (the overwhelmingly common case) see no runtime change. Apps with silently-tolerated duplicates today (sub-dep version mismatch, custom bundler config) will see their app throw at startup after upgrading with an error message naming the fix. `PYREON_SINGLE_INSTANCE=warn` is the immediate mitigation for any consumer surprised by the change.

  **Test coverage.** Contract tests at `packages/core/reactivity/src/tests/singleton-sentinel.test.ts` (57 specs) exercise the sentinel directly with synthetic `file://` URLs: default-mode throw + actionable error message, HMR re-eval allowance, `PYREON_SINGLE_INSTANCE=warn` / `=silent` escape hatches, per-package coverage across all 24 registered packages, and cross-package isolation. Bisect-verified — neutralizing the throw branch fails 49 positive-case tests; restored passes all 57. The synthetic-URL approach replaces the heavier filesystem dual-load reproducer (it's the sentinel's normalized-string comparison that matters, not Node's ESM loader behaviour).

### Patch Changes

- [#612](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/pull/612) [`c3d0a70`](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/commit/c3d0a7017ed2ef4468ec3fb4e4c09ec869d2917a) Thanks [@vitbokisch](https://github.com/vitbokisch)! - Security / memory-leak / correctness hardening sweep across core, fundamentals, and zero. 12 source-grounded defects fixed; every fix has a bisect-verified regression test (revert → fail → restore → pass).

  **Security (prototype pollution / XSS / DoS)**
  - `@pyreon/reactivity` `reconcile()` + `createStore` set trap — a documented "apply an untrusted API response into a store" path (`reconcile(JSON.parse(body), store)`) had no `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` guard. Added on both the write and stale-key-removal passes + defense-in-depth in the proxy set trap.
  - `@pyreon/i18n` `addMessages` — `nestFlatKeys` (dotted-key expansion) ran BEFORE `deepMerge`, so deepMerge's own pollution filter never saw the dotted form; `__proto__.x` walked into `Object.prototype` and wrote onto it. Message JSON is routinely CDN/community-sourced. Guarded.
  - `@pyreon/document` HTML renderer — `language` was interpolated raw into `<html lang="…">` and `styleStr` emitted string values raw into `style="…"`; a CMS/author-supplied value containing `"><script>` broke out → stored XSS. `lang` is now charset-restricted + escaped; style values route through the renderer's existing `sanitizeCss`.
  - `@pyreon/zero` rate-limit — `MAX_STORE_SIZE` was a declared-but-unenforced constant; the cleanup only evicted EXPIRED entries, so a flood of unique keys within one window (spoofable `X-Forwarded-For`) grew the Map unbounded — an unauthenticated memory-exhaustion DoS. Added a hard cap with oldest-first eviction (mirrors the ISR cache's proven `set()`).
  - `@pyreon/zero` ISR — the cache stored ANY response and replayed it as a 200 for the whole revalidate window: a transient 5xx/3xx became a self-inflicted outage, and a `Set-Cookie` response was replayed cross-user. Now only 2xx, cookie-free responses are cached; everything else passes through verbatim with its original status (`x-isr-cache: BYPASS`).
  - `@pyreon/server` `prerender` + `@pyreon/zero` SSG plugin (3 sites) — the path-traversal guard used a bare `startsWith(resolve(outDir))` (string-prefix, not path containment): a `getStaticPaths` slug resolving to the SIBLING `dist-evil/` passed and wrote outside the output root. Now separator-terminated containment (`isInsideDist`).
  - `@pyreon/zero` API-route matcher — dangerous param names from the route pattern guarded (defense-in-depth; consistent with the reconcile / i18n guards).

  **Memory leaks**
  - `@pyreon/reactivity` `signal._d` — direct-updater disposal nulled an array slot but never compacted, so a long-lived signal (theme/locale/auth, or signals read in `<For>` rows) bound by churning components accumulated one permanent dead slot per ever-mounted binding — an app-lifetime leak that ALSO degraded the signal-write hot path (`notifyDirect` iterated O(total-ever), not O(live)). Switched to a `Set` (same as `_s`): O(1) disposal, O(live) iteration, bounded growth. Proven structurally — `_d.size` stays 0 after 10 000 register/dispose cycles.
  - `@pyreon/dnd` `useSortable` — `itemRef` pushed every pdnd registration onto a shared array and the unmount (`ref(null)`) branch was a no-op, so a churning `<For>` sortable (todo list / kanban — the documented usage) leaked every removed item's draggable/dropTarget registration until the whole sortable unmounted. Now per-key disposal on unmount and re-register.
  - `@pyreon/zero` ISR — a hung revalidation handler pinned its key in the in-flight set forever (`finally` never ran), so the entry could never recover from stale. Background revalidation is now timeout-bounded (`ISRConfig.revalidateTimeoutMs`, default 30 s).

  **Correctness / silent-failure**
  - `@pyreon/router` `stringifyLoaderData` — the cycle detector used an all-seen `WeakSet` that was never pruned, so a shared (DAG) reference — extremely common, e.g. `{ author: user, lastEditor: user }` from an ORM — falsely threw "circular reference" and 500'd the SSR response. Replaced with true ancestor-path detection (the original code's own comment anticipated exactly this remedy). **Behaviour change (bug fix, strictly more permissive):** payloads that previously 500'd now serialize; real cycles still throw.
  - `@pyreon/server` `processTemplate` — used `String.prototype.replace` with string replacements, so rendered HTML containing literal `$&` / `$$` / `` $` `` / `$'` (prices, code, math) was corrupted by regex-pattern substitution. Switched to function replacements.
  - `@pyreon/i18n` `interpolate` — a serialization failure (circular value, throwing `toString`) was swallowed silently, rendering `{{key}}` to end users with no signal. Now dev-warns (fallback behaviour unchanged).
  - `@pyreon/query` `useSSE` — the reactive effect unconditionally reset `intentionalClose = false`, so an explicit `close()` was silently overridden by any later reactive `url`/`enabled` change. Now respects `intentionalClose` (mirrors `useSubscription`); `reconnect()` is the explicit resume.

  **Disclosures (honest scope)**
  - **An attempted SWR-swallow fix (surface the empty `.catch` via `__DEV__` warn + `_onError`) was REVERTED from this PR.** Probing empirically proved `revalidateSwrLoaders` is invoked **0 times** even by the canonical `staleWhileRevalidate` nav pattern: `resolveRoute` returns fresh `RouteRecord` objects per resolution, so `runLoaders`' `r.staleWhileRevalidate && router._loaderData.has(r)` gate is never true across navigations — the SWR branch is **dead code**, and the existing "revalidates in background" test's count actually comes from the blocking path running twice. Adding error-surfacing to provably-unreachable code is not hardening (and it dropped router coverage). **The real bug — `staleWhileRevalidate` is effectively non-functional for the nav-away/back case (record-identity-keyed gate)** — is a distinct, significant finding whose correct fix (key the gate by a stable path/loaderKey) is a non-trivial router behaviour change deserving its own focused, aligned PR. Documented in `router/src/tests/loader.test.ts` as a flagged follow-up; deliberately not bundled here (scope/risk).
  - One audit finding (`decodeKeyFromMarker`) was investigated and **dropped as a false positive** — `%2D` never appears in `encodeURIComponent` output, so the manual substitution is uniquely reversible.
  - Z5 (API-route param guard) is defense-in-depth: a string param value assigned to `__proto__` is a silent JS no-op (not exploitable); the guard prevents the real own-prop shadow for `constructor`/`prototype` and matches the repo-wide convention.

  Validation: lint 0 errors; typecheck clean (8 touched packages); gen-docs in sync; audit-types `--all --strict` 0 HIGH; bundle-budgets 54/54 within budget. Per-package suites all green (reactivity 294, router 520, server 78, i18n 155, document 269, dnd 111, query 151, zero 884).

  **Code — `prefetch="viewport"` refinements** (`components.tsx`):
  - IntersectionObserver now uses `rootMargin: '200px'` (was the implicit 0px). The prefetch starts _before_ the link is fully on screen, so a fast scroll-then-click typically lands on already-resolved loader data instead of waiting. Matches the margin instant.page / Astro use.
  - The prefetch is scheduled via `requestIdleCallback` (falls back to `setTimeout(1)` on Safari < 16.4 / jsdom) instead of running synchronously inside the observer callback — so it never contends with the scroll the user is actively performing. The observer disconnects _synchronously_ on first intersection before the idle slice is queued, so scroll jitter can't double-schedule.

  No behaviour change for `"intent"` (the default), `"hover"`, or `"none"`.

  **Docs — closed a discoverability gap.** `docs/docs/router.md` previously:
  - Omitted `'intent'` from the `prefetch` type entirely
  - Documented the default as `"hover"` — the actual default is `'intent'` (hover **and** keyboard focus)

  So readers couldn't discover that prefetch is on by default, and keyboard / screen-reader users' coverage (focus-triggered prefetch) was invisible. The Prefetch Strategies section is rewritten: corrected type + default, a strategy table, the accessibility rationale for why `"intent"` is the default, and a note on the viewport polish + dedup/eviction bound. CLAUDE.md's router prefetch line updated to match.

  Bisect-verified: reverted the `components.tsx` polish to the pre-fix shape → the new regression test `viewport prefetch uses 200px rootMargin + idle scheduling` failed at `expect(capturedRootMargin).toBe('200px')`; restored → all 3 viewport-prefetch tests pass. Full `@pyreon/router` suite: 519 tests pass (518 prior + 1 new).

- [#617](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/pull/617) [`2ee82eb`](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/commit/2ee82eb340c515c16aaa7a652ffc5b0c97b59ed6) Thanks [@vitbokisch](https://github.com/vitbokisch)! - Fix: `staleWhileRevalidate` route loaders now actually work for the realistic navigate-away-and-back case.

  **The bug.** `commitNavigation` pruned `router._loaderData` on every navigation — deleting any entry whose `RouteRecord` was not in the _new_ matched chain. Navigating away from a `staleWhileRevalidate` route therefore deleted its loader data, so on return `runLoaders`' `r.staleWhileRevalidate && router._loaderData.has(r)` gate was always false and the route went through the **blocking** loader path every time. `revalidateSwrLoaders` never ran; SWR was effectively a no-op (it only worked if you re-navigated to the route _without_ navigating away first — never the real-world pattern).

  **The fix.** The prune now skips `staleWhileRevalidate` records (`!to.matched.includes(record) && !record.staleWhileRevalidate`), so their last-loaded data survives navigating away — which is exactly SWR's contract: on return, serve the stale value immediately and revalidate in the background. Retained data is bounded by the number of SWR route _records_ (a developer-declared set; param routes share one record); per-key freshness/LRU is still handled by `_loaderCache`.

  **Behaviour change (bug fix, not breaking).** Returning to a `staleWhileRevalidate` route now resolves the navigation instantly with stale data + a background revalidation, instead of blocking on a fresh fetch — i.e. the documented behaviour, which previously never happened. No app could have depended on SWR being broken.

  **Note (corrects a prior disclosure).** PR [#612](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/issues/612) hypothesised the cause was `resolveRoute` returning fresh `RouteRecord` objects (identity-keyed gate never matching). That was **wrong** — record identity is stable. An instrumented probe pinned the true cause to the `commitNavigation` prune (SWR fires for `/data → /data`, but not `/data → / → /data`).

  **Verification.** The pre-existing `staleWhileRevalidate` test was strengthened into a load-bearing regression guard: the revalidation (2nd) loader call now takes a real ~40 ms delay, and the test asserts that immediately after the return navigation the served data is still the STALE `data-v1` (SWR returned without blocking) — pre-fix that navigation went through the blocking path and the data was already `data-v2`. Bisect-verified (revert the prune-skip → the stale-window assertion fails with `expected 'data-v2' to be 'data-v1'`, and the nav even takes ~45 ms because it blocked on the 40 ms loader; restore → 520/520 router tests pass). `bun run coverage` exits 0 with `@pyreon/router` at 91.19 % (the strengthened test now exercises the real `revalidateSwrLoaders` path).

- [#621](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/pull/621) [`4f410b6`](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/commit/4f410b6403ce1c033f049aa6cd2700f64193b2d1) Thanks [@vitbokisch](https://github.com/vitbokisch)! - Fix: a failing `staleWhileRevalidate` background revalidation no longer fails silently.

  `revalidateSwrLoaders`' rejection handler was an empty `.catch(() => {})`. A persistently-failing background revalidation loader (auth expiry, API outage, a bug thrown in the loader) therefore produced **zero signal** — the developer saw permanently-stale data with nothing pointing at the cause: exactly the silent-failure anti-pattern the project's own `anti-patterns.md` forbids ("Silent plugin/init error swallowing — always log in `__DEV__` and call the user `onError`").

  Now the rejection is surfaced like every other loader error: a `__DEV__` `console.warn` plus the user-supplied `router.onError(err, route)` hook. It does **not** act on the return value — the navigation already settled on stale data and must not be cancelled/redirected, and a failed revalidation must not clobber the still-valid stale value.

  **Context (why this wasn't fixed before).** This `.catch` was unreachable dead code until [#617](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/issues/617): the `commitNavigation` prune deleted SWR loader data on every nav-away, so `revalidateSwrLoaders` never ran for the realistic nav-away/back case. An earlier attempt to surface this error (in [#612](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/issues/612)) was correctly **reverted** at the time precisely because the path was dead — adding error-surfacing to unreachable code is not hardening, and it couldn't be tested. [#617](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/issues/617) made the SWR path live; this PR is the now-worthwhile, now-**testable** completion.

  **Verification.** New load-bearing regression test: `/data → / → /data` with the revalidation (2nd) loader call rejecting after a real 40 ms delay. Asserts the error reaches `onError` exactly once, the navigation is **not** cancelled (`currentRoute().path === '/data'`), and the stale value is retained (not clobbered by the failed revalidation). Bisect-verified: reverting the `.catch` to the empty body fails the test with `expected "vi.fn()" to be called 1 times, but got 0 times`; restored → 521/521 router tests pass. `bun run coverage` exit 0 (`@pyreon/router` 91.21 %); lint + typecheck clean.

- [#596](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/pull/596) [`e8e95bc`](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/commit/e8e95bc2d6785d397f4b8f85039ce76c2a7f6cea) Thanks [@vitbokisch](https://github.com/vitbokisch)! - Component-level HMR for zero/router apps — editing a route/page component now updates the DOM in place without a manual refresh, preserving module-scope signal state.

  Previously `@pyreon/vite-plugin`'s `injectHmr` emitted a bare `import.meta.hot.accept()` (no callback): Vite re-evaluated the edited module but nothing re-rendered the mounted tree, and the self-accept suppressed Vite's full-reload fallback — so every component/JSX edit produced a silently-stale UI until a manual browser refresh.

  Now the accept callback hands the fresh module to `globalThis.__pyreon_hmr_swap__` (registered by `@pyreon/router` in a dev browser, zero import coupling). The coordinator finds every active matched lazy route whose `_hmrId` matches (emitted by `@pyreon/zero`'s fs-router as `lazy(() => import(…), { hmrId })`), swaps the component, and bumps the loading signal so `RouterView` re-renders only that subtree in place — no page reload, so module-scope signals keep their values via the existing `__pyreon_hmr_registry__`. Edits outside the active route tree (nested components, unrelated routes, signal-only modules) or apps without the coordinator fall back to `import.meta.hot.invalidate()` → an automatic full reload (still no manual refresh). Production is unaffected (dev+browser gated).

Apps that ship a page-level `notFoundComponent` (e.g. `_404.tsx` at the route root without a wrapping `_layout.tsx`) used to render the not-found component bare — the documented "no chrome" limitation in CLAUDE.md. `findNotFoundFallback` now runs a two-pass walk: first the original layout-with-`notFoundComponent` pass (precedence preserved), then a fallback for page records with `notFoundComponent`. When the page-record pass fires, the resolver synthesizes a chain `[DefaultChromeLayout, syntheticLeaf]`. `DefaultChromeLayout` is a new built-in component rendering `<main data-pyreon-default-chrome><RouterView /></main>` — semantic-HTML landmark for accessibility / SEO + a `data-pyreon-default-chrome` attribute for users to target via CSS if they want to customize. No prescribed visual design. Graceful degradation: if `components.tsx` isn't imported (unit-test isolation), the setter doesn't fire and the fallback returns null, falling back to the standalone-render path. Bisect-verified across 4 layout-less specs in `match.test.ts`.

The SSG plugin's `__renderNotFound` now passes `{ isNotFound: true }` through `renderPath` → `router.preload(probePath, undefined, { skipLoaders: true })`, so auth-touching parent-layout loaders (`fetchUser`, session reads, private APIs) no longer fire during static 404 generation. Closes the documented "Loaders on parent layouts run during 404 render" limitation. Runtime SSR intentionally still runs loaders for 404 — analytics / audit-logging hooks that fire per-request should keep firing even when the request resolves to a not-found. Bisect-verified at the unit layer (4 new specs in `router.preload — PR C — skipLoaders`). Back-compat: the new arg is positional and optional, so 2-arg callers (`router.preload(path, request)`) continue to work unchanged.

  - **router**: `useBlocker` uses shared ref-counted `beforeunload` listener instead of per-blocker — prevents listener accumulation across multiple blockers
  - **router**: `destroy()` clears `_activeRouter` global ref and releases remaining blocker listeners — prevents stale router surviving in SSR/re-creation
  - **query/useSubscription**: close WebSocket BEFORE nulling handlers — prevents race where queued message fires null handler
  - **query/useSubscription**: respect `intentionalClose` when reactive deps change — user's explicit `close()` no longer gets overridden by signal change
  - **store**: plugin errors now logged with `__DEV__` console.warn instead of silently swallowed
  - **storage/IndexedDB**: initialization errors (corrupted DB, quota exceeded) now call `onError` callback and log in dev mode instead of silently falling back to default

  - **styler**: `DynamicStyled` uses one `computed()` per component (not `effect()`) to track theme + mode + dimension signals. The resolve itself runs `runUntracked()` to prevent exponential cascade. String-equality memoization eliminates redundant DOM updates. Per-definition WeakMap cache (Tier 2) skips resolve entirely for repeated identical inputs.
  - **styler**: `ThemeContext` is a `createReactiveContext<Theme>`. `useThemeAccessor()` returns the raw accessor for tracking inside computeds.
  - **ui-core**: `PyreonUI` nested `inversed` prop inherits parent mode reactively — inner section automatically flips when outer mode changes.
  - **unistyle**: `styles()` uses key→index lookup (Tier 1) — 257 descriptor iterations reduced to ~10-20 per call.
  - **rocketstyle**: passes `$rocketstyle`/`$rocketstate` as function accessors tracked by the styled computed.
  - **router**: `RouterLink` guards non-string `props.to` in activeClass (fixes SSR crash with `styled(RouterLink)`).
  - **core**: `popContext()` is a silent no-op on empty stack.

  Two router issues found during QA:
  1. **Prefetch/preload destroyed navigation abort capability.**
     `prefetchLoaderData` (called from `<Link>` hover) and `router.preload()`
     both assigned `router._abortController = new AbortController()`,
     overwriting the controller owned by an in-flight navigation. The
     navigation's `signal` became orphaned — subsequent calls to
     `router._abortController?.abort()` cancelled the prefetch instead of
     the actual navigation. Fixed: both operations now use a LOCAL
     `AbortController`; only real navigations touch the shared field.

  2. **`ScrollManager._positions` was unbounded.** Saved scroll position
     per distinct URL path, so SPAs with parametrised routes
     (`/user/:id`) or query-string variations accumulated entries
     forever. Added a 100-entry LRU cap — covers typical back-navigation
     depth; beyond that, scroll restoration is a nice-to-have not a
     correctness requirement.

  `@pyreon/router`:
  - `ScrollManager.save()` / `_applyResult()`: added `typeof window === 'undefined'`
    early-return guards so the SSR-safety contract is explicit at the method
    entry instead of relying on callers to pre-check.
  - `useBlocker`: replaced bare `if (beforeUnloadHandler)` guards with
    `if (_isBrowser && beforeUnloadHandler)` — same runtime behaviour (the
    handler is non-null only when `_isBrowser` is true), but links the check
    back to the typeof-derived const so `no-window-in-ssr` can prove the
    body is browser-safe.
  - `destroy()`: same pattern for `_popstateHandler` / `_hashchangeHandler`.
  - Error prefix normalised: `[pyreon-router]` → `[Pyreon]` (matches the
    `no-error-without-prefix` rule + the rest of the framework).

  `@pyreon/lint` — `no-window-in-ssr`:
  - Parameter-shadowing: identifiers like `location`/`history`/`navigator`
    that are FUNCTION PARAMETERS (or destructured parameter patterns) no
    longer false-positive as browser-global references. E.g. `router.push`
    takes a `location` parameter — inside its body, every `location`
    references the parameter, not `window.location`.
  - Typeof-derived `&&` chains in const bindings: `const useVT = _isBrowser
&& meta && typeof document.startViewTransition === 'function'` now
    registers `useVT` as typeof-bound, so `if (useVT) { document.X }` is
    recognised as guarded.

  `@pyreon/lint` — `no-imperative-navigate-in-render`:
  - Full rewrite of the safe-context detection. Previously only recognised
    `onMount`/`effect`/`onUnmount` call callbacks as safe — this false-fired
    on `router.push()` inside any locally-declared event handler
    (`const handleClick = (e) => router.push(...)`). Now tracks a
    `nestedFnDepth` counter across ALL nested functions inside a component
    body, so any nested ArrowFn/FunctionExpression is treated as deferred
    execution. Fires only on direct-in-render-body imperative navigation —
    which is the actual bug the rule is designed to catch.

  `@pyreon/lint` — `no-dom-in-setup`:
  - Extended safe-context set: now includes `onUnmount`, `onCleanup`,
    `renderEffect`, and `requestAnimationFrame`. `document.querySelector`
    inside a `requestAnimationFrame` callback is guaranteed to run in a
    browser frame post-setup, so it doesn't warrant the setup-phase warning.

  9 new bisect-verified regression tests for the three rule precision
  improvements.
