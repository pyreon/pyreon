/**
 * Register a direct updater — lighter than subscribe().
 * Used by compiler-emitted _bindText/_bindDirect for zero-overhead DOM bindings.
 *
 * Two-tier storage:
 *
 *  1. **Single-subscriber inline slot `_d1`** — first subscriber stored
 *     directly on the signal as a single field. No Set allocation, no
 *     iteration overhead. This is the steady-state shape for ~all
 *     per-row label/class bindings inside `<For>` rows — 10k rows = 10k
 *     signals each with exactly 1 `_bindText` subscriber.
 *  2. **Promotion to `_d: Set` on second subscribe** — when a second
 *     subscriber arrives, `_d1` is migrated into a fresh Set + the new
 *     subscriber is added. From that point on, the signal uses the Set
 *     path (same as before).
 *
 * Disposal is O(1) in both shapes:
 *  - Inline shape: `if (_d1 === updater) _d1 = null` — no memory leak
 *    (one slot, cleared on dispose).
 *  - Set shape: `_d.delete(updater)` — standard Set semantics.
 *
 * **Why not flat array (the previously-rejected form)**: the array form
 * disposed by nulling the slot (`arr[idx] = null`) but never compacted —
 * so a long-lived signal (theme/locale/auth) bound by churning components
 * accumulated one permanent dead slot per ever-mounted binding. That was
 * an app-lifetime memory leak. The current two-tier shape avoids this:
 * `_d1` is single-slot (no leak by construction); `_d` is a Set (no
 * leak; standard semantics).
 *
 * **Why not always Set**: Set allocation is ~96 bytes + the per-call cost
 * of `set.add` / Set iterator allocation per notify. For ~10k single-
 * subscriber signals (the benchmark's per-row label shape) this is
 * ~960KB heap + 10k Set construction operations + ~50µs of iterator
 * overhead per partial-update cycle. Inline slot eliminates all of that
 * for the dominant case.
