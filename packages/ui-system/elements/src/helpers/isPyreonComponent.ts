/**
 * Detect whether a function value is a component (framework-marked OR
 * user-authored bare function), as opposed to a plain reactive-accessor
 * function.
 *
 * Used by `Element` / `Content` `resolveSlot` to discriminate between
 *   `beforeContent={Header}` — component-reference shorthand, MUST mount
 *     as `h(Component, null)` so the framework's runWithHooks setup
 *     window is established (and any framework HOC's
 *     `removeUndefinedProps(props)` / `splitProps(props)` get the
 *     default-filled props object, not bare `undefined`).
 *   `beforeContent={() => <Header />}` — anonymous reactive accessor,
 *     called bare so its body's signal reads land inside the enclosing
 *     `mountReactive` effect.
 *
 * Both shapes are `typeof === 'function'`. The discriminator combines two
 * checks (most-specific-first):
 *
 *   **Tier 1 — framework markers** (load-bearing for HOC pipelines):
 *     - `IS_ROCKETSTYLE` — set by `@pyreon/rocketstyle`
 *       (`rocketstyle.ts:527`, `542`) on every `rocketstyle(...).config(...)`
 *       chain end-point.
 *     - `PYREON__COMPONENT` — set by every `@pyreon/elements` component
 *       factory (Element, Text, List, Portal, Overlay, Util, Content,
 *       Wrapper, …).
 *     - `pkgName` — same components also carry this; checked as a fallback
 *       in case a third-party package mirrors the elements convention.
 *
 *   **Tier 2 — naming convention** (catches user-authored bare components
 *   without markers):
 *     - `displayName` is set → component. Authors set displayName
 *       deliberately for devtools / debug output; it's an explicit
 *       declaration of component intent.
 *     - `.name` starts with an uppercase letter → component. JSX already
 *       requires PascalCase for components (`<MyComp/>` is treated as a
 *       component; `<mycomp/>` is treated as a host tag); the discriminator
 *       mirrors that convention for slot-shorthand usage. Anonymous
 *       arrows (`name: ""`), default-export functions (`name: "default"`),
 *       and camelCase helpers fall through to the accessor path.
 *
 * Why Tier 2 matters — the bug class it closes: a bare-function component
 * that internally uses lifecycle hooks (`useWindowResize`, `onMount`,
 * `provide`, etc.) needs a `runWithHooks` setup window so the hook calls
 * find `_current` non-null. Without Tier 2, `resolveSlot` would call the
 * function bare → `_current === null` → `[Pyreon] onMount() called outside
 * component setup` warning fires in dev-mode SSR. Routing the same
 * function through `h(value, null)` mounts it as a proper component via
 * the standard `runWithHooks`-based path; the hooks register correctly
 * AND the warning never fires.
 *
 * Why the convention split is safe: a PascalCase function paired with
 * the `beforeContent={Fn}` shorthand is canonically a component reference
 * (matches every framework example in the docs). An anonymous arrow
 * `() => signal() ? <A/> : <B/>` is canonically a reactive accessor
 * (intent: re-evaluate on signal change). The naming convention is the
 * same one JSX itself uses to differentiate component vs host element.
 *
 * Before this check, `resolveSlot` called any function-valued slot
 * bare, crashing real consumers that used the
 * `beforeContent={Component}` shorthand documented since the original
 * Element API. The marker check (Tier 1) rescues framework-factory
 * components; this Tier-2 convention check closes the residual gap
 * for user-authored hook-using bare components.
