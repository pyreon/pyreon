# @pyreon/rx

## 0.52.0

### Minor Changes

- [#3651](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/pull/3651) [`9d6ca3d`](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/commit/9d6ca3d705b555a2bb52d6dfd0c5fe231ff69f5c) Thanks [@vitbokisch](https://github.com/vitbokisch)! - Hardening pass across six fundamentals packages.

  **@pyreon/rx** — `groupBy` / `keyBy` / `countBy` / `mapValues` now build prototype-free records (`Object.create(null)`). A key named `constructor` made `groupBy` throw and `countBy` produce `'function Object() …1'`; a `__proto__` key was written as the result's prototype and vanished. Behaviour change: the results no longer inherit from `Object.prototype` (call `Object.hasOwn(result, k)`, not `result.hasOwnProperty(k)`). `search()` gains signal/plain overloads (a plain call is typed `T[]`, a signal call a computed) instead of `any`.

  **@pyreon/machine** — event and state names are looked up as OWN keys, so `send('toString')` is an unhandled event instead of moving the machine into an undefined state; an initial/target named after an `Object.prototype` member is rejected at creation. A throwing `onExit` / `onEnter` / `onTransition` / `onDone` listener is reported (`console.error`, `[Pyreon]` prefix) and no longer aborts the transition midway. Behaviour change: `send()` called from inside a listener is QUEUED and runs after the current macrostep completes (run-to-completion), instead of running nested in the middle of it; such a call returns the state as it is at that moment.

  **@pyreon/permissions** — behaviour change: `usePermissions([])` is a self-contained deny-all instance; it no longer falls back to the provider's instance (the mode is chosen by the presence of the argument, not its length). The native lowering makes the same choice. The resolve memo is re-enabled once `patch()` replaces the last predicate with a boolean. `can.all` / `can.any` accept an array plus a context (`can.all(['a', 'b'], post)`) so multi-checks reach context-dependent predicates; the rest-args form is unchanged.

  **@pyreon/i18n** — `<Trans>` no longer lets an interpolated value create markup: angle brackets in values are neutralised before tags are parsed, so `x</bold><link>…` renders as text instead of invoking the `link` component. Loader-returned namespaces get the same normalization as `messages` (flat dotted keys expanded, unsafe keys dropped, a store-owned deep copy). Behaviour change: locales resolve along the BCP 47 step-down chain (`en-US` → `en` → `fallbackLocale`, itself stepped down). Key paths, inline format names and custom plural rules are OWN-property lookups (`t('a.constructor.name')` no longer returns `'Object'`). `$t()` nesting no longer re-interpolates a nested result, so a value that looks like `{{x}}` is not substituted twice. The `Intl.PluralRules` cache and the per-instance resolution cache are LRU-bounded (the resolution cache used to stop caching entirely after 2000 keys).

  **@pyreon/url-state** — signals now follow navigations made through the registered router (`router.push('?page=2')`, `<RouterLink>`), including a router registered after the signal was created (`UrlRouter` gains an optional `currentRoute`, which `@pyreon/router` already provides). Behaviour changes: array params keep their element type, inferred from the default's first element (`[0]` → `number[]`), and a `,` inside an element round-trips; a lone custom `serialize` or `deserialize` is honoured (the other half is inferred), and with `arrayFormat: 'repeat'` a custom codec applies per element; `onChange` fires only when the value actually changed; an empty number param (`?page=`) and an unrecognised boolean fall back to the default, and booleans accept `1`/`0`. The native lowering decodes empty numbers and booleans the same way.

  **@pyreon/table** — `flexRenderCell` tracks the cell renderer itself (the lookup stays untracked), so a renderer reading table state such as `info.row.getIsSelected()` updates on that change; data edits still re-run only the edited row. `columnSignature` covers group columns' children and the `cell` / `header` / `footer` renderers (by source text, so an inline column literal stays stable), so a renderer swap re-renders the cells. Cleanup is registered on the owning `EffectScope` instead of `onUnmount`, so `useTable` in a store no longer warns.

  **@pyreon/atlas** — the permission-set recorder wraps the new array form of `can.all` / `can.any` too, so keys passed that way are seeded with the role's policy and recorded as consulted.

### Patch Changes

- [#2752](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/pull/2752) [`e0e0dc0`](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/commit/e0e0dc066470e92066652ccbd739ae0d6e518c58) Thanks [@vitbokisch](https://github.com/vitbokisch)! - Eight README examples are now typechecked in CI.

  `check-doc-examples` only ever looked at `docs/src/content/docs/**`; package READMEs carry ~550 `ts`/`tsx` blocks and nothing verified any of them. The gate now walks package READMEs too, and each of these packages has one verified-clean example opted in with the `// @check` marker.

  Each was compiled before being marked, not marked and then debugged. No content changed — the marker is a comment inside the fence.

- [#3090](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/pull/3090) [`bc71a6d`](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/commit/bc71a6d5f137377ef52c16e6b40a8dce840145bd) Thanks [@vitbokisch](https://github.com/vitbokisch)! - perf: arity-specialize `combine` to drop per-emit allocations

  `combine(...sources, fn)` recomputes on every input change (e.g. per keystroke
  for a derived field), and the variadic body `fn(...sources.map((s) => s()))`
  allocated a fresh `map` array plus a spread arguments object on every emit.

  Read the fixed 2–4 sources directly (`fn(a(), b())`), capturing the signals once
  at setup instead of mapping per emit. Behavior-identical — every arity (2–6
  sources) is covered by the existing tests, and the 5+ case keeps the variadic
  fallback.

- [#2812](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/pull/2812) [`fc7d62d`](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/commit/fc7d62dd3928a60f0b788e98ffaf0180a8b3c83e) Thanks [@vitbokisch](https://github.com/vitbokisch)! - fix(rx): `sortBy` with a string key sorts numeric fields numerically (was lexicographic); `last(x, 0)` returns `[]`

  Two collection-op correctness fixes:

  - **`sortBy(items, 'field')`** resolved the key through the shared `resolveKey`, which `String()`-coerces, then compared the stringified keys directly — so a numeric field sorted lexicographically: `sortBy(products, 'price')` on `[2, 10, 1, 9]` returned `[1, 10, 2, 9]` instead of `[1, 2, 9, 10]`. `sortBy` now compares the RAW `item[key]` value (a number stays a number); the function-key form was already correct. `resolveKey` stays coercive for `groupBy`/`keyBy`/`countBy`/`uniqBy`, which genuinely want string record keys. Single-digit test fixtures masked this (lexicographic == numeric order for single digits).
  - **`last(items, 0)`** returned the whole array — `slice(-0)` === `slice(0)`. It now returns `[]`.

  Both bisect-verified with multi-digit / zero fixtures.

- [#3557](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/pull/3557) [`5c60743`](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/commit/5c60743c32bac8c46279fccacc5a51126b183832) Thanks [@vitbokisch](https://github.com/vitbokisch)! - Stop publishing the build's bundle-analysis report.

  `vl_rolldown_build` writes an HTML treemap per entry into `lib/analysis/`, and
  54 packages published it: every install downloaded a build report (258 KB for
  `@pyreon/charts`) that is not part of the package. Their `files` now exclude
  `lib/analysis`, as ten packages already did. `pyreon doctor`'s distribution
  gate enforces it twice: a `vl_rolldown_build` package that publishes `lib`
  must exclude the report, and the live `npm pack --dry-run` probe fails if the
  tarball carries one.

  - @pyreon/reactivity@0.52.0

## 0.51.0

### Patch Changes

- Every package manifest now declares its MULTIPLATFORM story as data: (4e53471)
  `multiplatform: { tier: 'shared' | 'service-backend' | 'web-only', rationale }`
  (a discriminated union — `web-only` REQUIRES the rationale sentence). The
  assignments transcribe the classification the multiplatform docs and the PMTC
  compiler's own `WEB_ONLY_PACKAGES` registry already maintain, and the new
  `check-multiplatform-tier` gate (validate-fast family) holds the contract:
  a manifest without a tier, a published package with neither manifest nor
  explicit exemption, a `web-only` without a rationale, or a stale generated
  tier table all fail CI — so a new package can never again silently default
  to web-only while the ecosystem advertises "one codebase, three targets".

  No runtime change in any package: manifests are docs-pipeline inputs and are
  stripped from published tarballs; every generated surface (llms, MCP
  api-reference, reference pages) is byte-identical.

  - **`intersection` / `difference` / `union`** — set operations by identity or by `key` selector, **signal-aware on BOTH inputs** (either input may be a signal; the result recomputes when either changes). `O(n + m)` via a `Set`; `union` is order-preserving (source first, first occurrence wins).
  - **`sortBy` direction** — optional third parameter `'asc' | 'desc'` (default `'asc'`, fully back-compatible); descending no longer requires composing `reverse`.

  - **Fix (leak class I)**: `debounce`/`throttle` now clear their pending `setTimeout` when their owning `effectScope` is disposed (component unmount), not only on an explicit `dispose()`. Previously a component that unmounted mid-debounce left a timer that fired post-unmount, mutating a subscriber-less signal. The effect's returned cleanup now owns timer cancellation in one place.
  - **`distinct`/`scan` lifecycle**: both now return `& { dispose() }` (matching `debounce`/`throttle`) so standalone usage can release the eager `effect()`; inside a component/`effectScope` they remain auto-torn-down. All four dispose handles are idempotent.
  - **New transforms (39 total, up from 37)**: `flatMap` (map + flatten one level) and `countBy` (per-bucket counts, the counting companion to `groupBy`), both overloaded `Signal<T[]> → Computed` / `T[] → plain`.
  - **Wider typed overloads**: `combine` (up to 6 sources), `zip` (up to 4 arrays), `pipe` (up to 7 transforms) — the runtime already supported N; the added overloads remove the "falls back to `any`" type gap.
  - **Docs**: fixed the README `search` example (`{ keys }` → positional `['name','email']`); softened the `debounce`/`throttle` "never auto-cleaned" claim (they ARE auto-cleaned in a component scope); documented the `pipe` 1-node-vs-N-node composition win with exact node/recompute counts.
  - **Bench**: `bun run --filter=@pyreon/rx bench` now reports (A) the deterministic `pipe`-vs-naive composition structure (1 node / 1 recompute vs N / N) and (B) per-op re-derive cost against the fair signal-based peers — hand-written Pyreon `computed` and Solid `createMemo` — with RxJS reframed as a scale-context row, not the peer (it's a push-stream library, not pull-based signal derivation).

  Several package manifests carried inaccuracies that would break copied code. Corrected
  against source + regenerated the AI-facing doc surfaces (`@pyreon/mcp`'s `api-reference.ts`
  ships the corrected `get_api` data):

  - **rx**: removed the fabricated "curried operators" model — `pipe(source, ...fns)` threads
    the value through plain `(value) => value` transforms; `filter`/`map`/`sortBy` are always
    2-arg `(source, …)` (no 1-arg curried form).
  - **hotkeys**: the real option is `enableOnInputs` (not the fabricated `enableOnFormElements`);
    scopes are not reference-counted.
  - **url-state**: options are `debounce` / `replace` (not `debounceMs` / `replaceState`); SSR
    initializes to the default value (it does not read the request URL).
  - **storage**: custom-backend methods are `get` / `set` / `remove`; serializer options are
    `serializer` / `deserializer`.
  - **document**: the format string is `google-chat` (not `gchat`).

  PR 1 of the "whole-repo coverage ≥ 95%" initiative (user-approved sequence:
  by-gap-size, start with quick wins).

  Every package in this bump is **already reporting ≥ 95% actual** per
  `bun scripts/check-coverage.ts`. Locking the configured threshold in
  match prevents regressions and lets the `Coverage (Full)` CI gate enforce
  the new floor.

  **No runtime changes, no test additions** — pure config update.
  Drift-detection in `BELOW_FLOOR_EXEMPTIONS` was triggered for two
  exemption entries (`@pyreon/code`, `@pyreon/kinetic`) which had been
  listed with `currentStatements: 94`; updated to 95 with the new reason
  documenting the lift.

  Every `@pyreon/*` package now ships its `.js.map` and `.d.ts.map` files. The previous `!lib/**/*.map` exclusion in each package's `files` array left every emitted JS file pointing at a `//# sourceMappingURL=*.map` that wasn't actually published — causing Vite (and other bundlers) to log a "Failed to load source map" warning per file on every cold dev start. Real bug in shipped tarballs, not just dev-noise theory.

  The fix is shipping the maps. They make framework stack traces readable: `at mountChild (node_modules/@pyreon/runtime-dom/src/nodes.ts:147)` instead of `at e (node_modules/@pyreon/runtime-dom/lib/index.js:1:42857)`. This matters most when a user hits a framework bug, opens devtools, or sees an unreadable production error from a server-side render. Sentry / Bugsnag / Rollbar can also translate framework frames using the shipped maps; without them, the framework's part of every captured stack stays opaque.

  Cost: ~350KB-1MB per package in `node_modules`. Bundlers (Vite, Webpack, Rollup, esbuild) strip source maps from production builds automatically; they never reach end users. Every comparable library (React, Vue, Solid, Preact, Svelte, TanStack) does this.

  No API changes. The `check-distribution` CI gate inverts to enforce the new contract (maps must be present, not absent).

### Patch Changes

- [#606](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/pull/606) [`fde0f41`](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/commit/fde0f41ad6312ad0ee45d8e70ece965d7c4fec41) Thanks [@vitbokisch](https://github.com/vitbokisch)! - Fix the biggest MCP `get_api` quality gap: enrich + correct the two thinnest fundamentals manifests, and add a ratchet so density can't silently erode.

  **The gap (measured, via the authoritative `findManifests` loader — the same one `get_api` uses):**

  - `@pyreon/rx`: **3** `api[]` entries for 37 functions. `get_api(rx, sortBy)` / `(rx, debounce)` / `(rx, search)` / `(rx, groupBy)` all **404'd** — agents got nothing for the most-used transforms.
  - `@pyreon/store`: `StoreApi` referenced **3× in `seeAlso`** with no `api[]` entry — `get_api(store, StoreApi)` 404'd despite being the central return type.

  **Plus four real inaccuracies in the existing rx manifest** that were actively _misleading_ AI agents (found by grounding every claim in source, not assuming):

  1. "signals detected by checking for a `.subscribe` method" — false; detection is purely `typeof source === "function"` (`rx/src/types.ts`).
  2. "pass `items` not `() => items()`" — backwards; an accessor wrapper _is_ a function and works. The real mistake is passing a resolved `items()` (static path, never updates).
  3. `groupBy` documented as returning `Computed<Map<…>>` — it returns `Record<string, T[]>` (keys `String()`-coerced).
  4. `search` documented as `{ keys: [...] }` options + "fuzzy" — it's a positional `keys` array and plain case-insensitive `String.includes` (not fuzzy).

  **Fixed (delta, authoritative counts):**

  - `@pyreon/store`: 5 → **6** entries, 2 → **6** with `mistakes[]` (added `StoreApi` entry; added grounded foot-gun catalogs to `addStorePlugin` / `resetStore` / `resetAllStores`; expanded `defineStore`). Every foot-gun traced to real source behaviour (plugin-runs-once-at-creation, silent `patch({typoKey})` no-op, `__proto__` guard, registry-detach semantics, `store.pluginRun` O(stores×plugins)).
  - `@pyreon/rx`: 3 → **9** entries, 2 → **9** with `mistakes[]` (added `map`/`sortBy`/`groupBy`/`search`/`debounce`/`throttle`; beefed `filter`/`pipe`/`rx`) **and the 4 inaccuracies corrected** across summary, longExample, gotchas, and per-entry notes.

  **Proven end-to-end:** a real MCP client↔server round-trip confirms `get_api(rx, sortBy|debounce|search|groupBy)` and `get_api(store, StoreApi)` now resolve with `Common mistakes` sections (were 404), and `get_api(rx, groupBy)` returns `Record`, not `Map`, through the live tool.

  **Structural fix so this can't recur:** new `scripts/check-manifest-depth.ts` ratchet + required `Check Manifest Depth` CI job. `LOCKED` records each migrated package's _achieved_ `{ minEntries, minWithMistakes }` (store 6/6, rx 9/9, query 16/11, form 7/7 — counted via `findManifests`). The gate fails if a locked package erodes; not-yet-migrated packages are intentionally absent (the visible backlog) so it never flag-days CI. Bisect-verified: removing the `StoreApi` entry fails the gate on `@pyreon/store`; restored → passes.

  Per-package `manifest-snapshot` tests updated (regenerated inline snapshots now capture the _corrected_ content; regression-guard assertions added so the 4 inaccuracies can't reappear). `gen-docs` regenerated `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt` / `api-reference.ts` — in sync.
