### Patch Changes

- [#902](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/pull/902) [`b87fbac`](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/commit/b87fbaced0cbeb7304bdc1d358040818e4b1491e) Thanks [@vitbokisch](https://github.com/vitbokisch)! - Ship source maps in published tarballs.

  Every `@pyreon/*` package now ships its `.js.map` and `.d.ts.map` files. The previous `!lib/**/*.map` exclusion in each package's `files` array left every emitted JS file pointing at a `//# sourceMappingURL=*.map` that wasn't actually published — causing Vite (and other bundlers) to log a "Failed to load source map" warning per file on every cold dev start. Real bug in shipped tarballs, not just dev-noise theory.

  The fix is shipping the maps. They make framework stack traces readable: `at mountChild (node_modules/@pyreon/runtime-dom/src/nodes.ts:147)` instead of `at e (node_modules/@pyreon/runtime-dom/lib/index.js:1:42857)`. This matters most when a user hits a framework bug, opens devtools, or sees an unreadable production error from a server-side render. Sentry / Bugsnag / Rollbar can also translate framework frames using the shipped maps; without them, the framework's part of every captured stack stays opaque.

  Cost: ~350KB-1MB per package in `node_modules`. Bundlers (Vite, Webpack, Rollup, esbuild) strip source maps from production builds automatically; they never reach end users. Every comparable library (React, Vue, Solid, Preact, Svelte, TanStack) does this.

  No API changes. The `check-distribution` CI gate inverts to enforce the new contract (maps must be present, not absent).

### Patch Changes

- [#883](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/pull/883) [`6075127`](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/commit/60751278894a6ff843c0f6f6c4894c76bcb6a720) Thanks [@vitbokisch](https://github.com/vitbokisch)! - Singleton sentinel default-on across every `@pyreon/*` package with module-level state (PR A of the bullet-proof cross-module-instance plan, `.claude/plans/jaunty-herding-kazoo.md`).

  Each package's `src/index.ts` now calls `registerSingleton('@pyreon/<name>', <version>, import.meta.url)` at module load. The first registration records a marker on `globalThis`; a second registration with a DIFFERENT normalized location triggers detection. Default mode throws an actionable Error naming both file paths and three concrete fixes (Vite `resolve.dedupe`, `npm ls`, `bun ls`). `PYREON_SINGLE_INSTANCE=warn` demotes to `console.error`; `PYREON_SINGLE_INSTANCE=silent` opts out entirely (browser extensions, micro-frontends, nested SSR via `rocketstyle-collapse`).

  **HMR-aware.** Vite re-evaluates modules with the SAME path but possibly different query params (`?v=12345`, `?t=12345`, `?import`). The sentinel normalizes the location (strips query string) before comparing — same normalized location → HMR re-eval → silently allowed; different location → genuine dual-instance → throws.

  **Per-package detection.** The earlier prototype put the sentinel only in `@pyreon/reactivity` — insufficient because `@pyreon/core` (and every other package) has its own module-level state that can be silently corrupted under dual-load. The full plan requires per-package registration, which this PR ships.

  **Zero behavior change in correct setups.** Apps that already have a single instance of each `@pyreon/*` package (the overwhelmingly common case) see no runtime change. Apps with silently-tolerated duplicates today (sub-dep version mismatch, custom bundler config) will see their app throw at startup after upgrading with an error message naming the fix. `PYREON_SINGLE_INSTANCE=warn` is the immediate mitigation for any consumer surprised by the change.

  **Test coverage.** Contract tests at `packages/core/reactivity/src/tests/singleton-sentinel.test.ts` (57 specs) exercise the sentinel directly with synthetic `file://` URLs: default-mode throw + actionable error message, HMR re-eval allowance, `PYREON_SINGLE_INSTANCE=warn` / `=silent` escape hatches, per-package coverage across all 24 registered packages, and cross-package isolation. Bisect-verified — neutralizing the throw branch fails 49 positive-case tests; restored passes all 57. The synthetic-URL approach replaces the heavier filesystem dual-load reproducer (it's the sentinel's normalized-string comparison that matters, not Node's ESM loader behaviour).

### Patch Changes

- [#612](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/pull/612) [`c3d0a70`](https://github.com/pyreon/pyreon/commit/c3d0a7017ed2ef4468ec3fb4e4c09ec869d2917a) Thanks [@vitbokisch](https://github.com/vitbokisch)! - Security / memory-leak / correctness hardening sweep across core, fundamentals, and zero. 12 source-grounded defects fixed; every fix has a bisect-verified regression test (revert → fail → restore → pass).

  **Security (prototype pollution / XSS / DoS)**
  - `@pyreon/reactivity` `reconcile()` + `createStore` set trap — a documented "apply an untrusted API response into a store" path (`reconcile(JSON.parse(body), store)`) had no `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` guard. Added on both the write and stale-key-removal passes + defense-in-depth in the proxy set trap.
  - `@pyreon/i18n` `addMessages` — `nestFlatKeys` (dotted-key expansion) ran BEFORE `deepMerge`, so deepMerge's own pollution filter never saw the dotted form; `__proto__.x` walked into `Object.prototype` and wrote onto it. Message JSON is routinely CDN/community-sourced. Guarded.
  - `@pyreon/document` HTML renderer — `language` was interpolated raw into `<html lang="…">` and `styleStr` emitted string values raw into `style="…"`; a CMS/author-supplied value containing `"><script>` broke out → stored XSS. `lang` is now charset-restricted + escaped; style values route through the renderer's existing `sanitizeCss`.
  - `@pyreon/zero` rate-limit — `MAX_STORE_SIZE` was a declared-but-unenforced constant; the cleanup only evicted EXPIRED entries, so a flood of unique keys within one window (spoofable `X-Forwarded-For`) grew the Map unbounded — an unauthenticated memory-exhaustion DoS. Added a hard cap with oldest-first eviction (mirrors the ISR cache's proven `set()`).
  - `@pyreon/zero` ISR — the cache stored ANY response and replayed it as a 200 for the whole revalidate window: a transient 5xx/3xx became a self-inflicted outage, and a `Set-Cookie` response was replayed cross-user. Now only 2xx, cookie-free responses are cached; everything else passes through verbatim with its original status (`x-isr-cache: BYPASS`).
  - `@pyreon/server` `prerender` + `@pyreon/zero` SSG plugin (3 sites) — the path-traversal guard used a bare `startsWith(resolve(outDir))` (string-prefix, not path containment): a `getStaticPaths` slug resolving to the SIBLING `dist-evil/` passed and wrote outside the output root. Now separator-terminated containment (`isInsideDist`).
  - `@pyreon/zero` API-route matcher — dangerous param names from the route pattern guarded (defense-in-depth; consistent with the reconcile / i18n guards).

  **Memory leaks**
  - `@pyreon/reactivity` `signal._d` — direct-updater disposal nulled an array slot but never compacted, so a long-lived signal (theme/locale/auth, or signals read in `<For>` rows) bound by churning components accumulated one permanent dead slot per ever-mounted binding — an app-lifetime leak that ALSO degraded the signal-write hot path (`notifyDirect` iterated O(total-ever), not O(live)). Switched to a `Set` (same as `_s`): O(1) disposal, O(live) iteration, bounded growth. Proven structurally — `_d.size` stays 0 after 10 000 register/dispose cycles.
  - `@pyreon/dnd` `useSortable` — `itemRef` pushed every pdnd registration onto a shared array and the unmount (`ref(null)`) branch was a no-op, so a churning `<For>` sortable (todo list / kanban — the documented usage) leaked every removed item's draggable/dropTarget registration until the whole sortable unmounted. Now per-key disposal on unmount and re-register.
  - `@pyreon/zero` ISR — a hung revalidation handler pinned its key in the in-flight set forever (`finally` never ran), so the entry could never recover from stale. Background revalidation is now timeout-bounded (`ISRConfig.revalidateTimeoutMs`, default 30 s).

  **Correctness / silent-failure**
  - `@pyreon/router` `stringifyLoaderData` — the cycle detector used an all-seen `WeakSet` that was never pruned, so a shared (DAG) reference — extremely common, e.g. `{ author: user, lastEditor: user }` from an ORM — falsely threw "circular reference" and 500'd the SSR response. Replaced with true ancestor-path detection (the original code's own comment anticipated exactly this remedy). **Behaviour change (bug fix, strictly more permissive):** payloads that previously 500'd now serialize; real cycles still throw.
  - `@pyreon/server` `processTemplate` — used `String.prototype.replace` with string replacements, so rendered HTML containing literal `$&` / `$$` / `` $` `` / `$'` (prices, code, math) was corrupted by regex-pattern substitution. Switched to function replacements.
  - `@pyreon/i18n` `interpolate` — a serialization failure (circular value, throwing `toString`) was swallowed silently, rendering `{{key}}` to end users with no signal. Now dev-warns (fallback behaviour unchanged).
  - `@pyreon/query` `useSSE` — the reactive effect unconditionally reset `intentionalClose = false`, so an explicit `close()` was silently overridden by any later reactive `url`/`enabled` change. Now respects `intentionalClose` (mirrors `useSubscription`); `reconnect()` is the explicit resume.

  **Disclosures (honest scope)**
  - **An attempted SWR-swallow fix (surface the empty `.catch` via `__DEV__` warn + `_onError`) was REVERTED from this PR.** Probing empirically proved `revalidateSwrLoaders` is invoked **0 times** even by the canonical `staleWhileRevalidate` nav pattern: `resolveRoute` returns fresh `RouteRecord` objects per resolution, so `runLoaders`' `r.staleWhileRevalidate && router._loaderData.has(r)` gate is never true across navigations — the SWR branch is **dead code**, and the existing "revalidates in background" test's count actually comes from the blocking path running twice. Adding error-surfacing to provably-unreachable code is not hardening (and it dropped router coverage). **The real bug — `staleWhileRevalidate` is effectively non-functional for the nav-away/back case (record-identity-keyed gate)** — is a distinct, significant finding whose correct fix (key the gate by a stable path/loaderKey) is a non-trivial router behaviour change deserving its own focused, aligned PR. Documented in `router/src/tests/loader.test.ts` as a flagged follow-up; deliberately not bundled here (scope/risk).
  - One audit finding (`decodeKeyFromMarker`) was investigated and **dropped as a false positive** — `%2D` never appears in `encodeURIComponent` output, so the manual substitution is uniquely reversible.
  - Z5 (API-route param guard) is defense-in-depth: a string param value assigned to `__proto__` is a silent JS no-op (not exploitable); the guard prevents the real own-prop shadow for `constructor`/`prototype` and matches the repo-wide convention.

  Validation: lint 0 errors; typecheck clean (8 touched packages); gen-docs in sync; audit-types `--all --strict` 0 HIGH; bundle-budgets 54/54 within budget. Per-package suites all green (reactivity 294, router 520, server 78, i18n 155, document 269, dnd 111, query 151, zero 884).
